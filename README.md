# SignUp-Login-RoomDatabase

The application is based on User Authentication via Login and SignUp. Users have to first register through SignUp screen and then login through the given credentials.
After login and signUp, there is a home screen for that particular user in which he can add its new friends via floating action button. The Home screen also contains a Logout button through which the User can logged himself out and a new user can login.
